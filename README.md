# PaperStrip
/*
 * You are given two paper strips. On each strip, numbers (1, 2.... n) are written in random order.
 * Cut the original paper strip in several pieces adn rearrange those pieces to form the desired sequence.
 * Write a function that returns the minimum number of pieces to form the desired operation.
 *      For example, the following code should display 3 beacuse the pieces shoudl be (1), (4,3) and (2). 
        int[] original = new int[]{1, 4, 3, 2};
        int[] desired = new int[]{1, 2, 4, 3};
        System.out.println(PaperStrip.minPieces(original, desired));
